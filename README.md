# Nova Renderer (DirectX 12)

Welcome to the Nova Renderer (DX12) repository. This is a personal project I’m working on while learning DirectX 12. After spending time with OpenGL, I decided to dive into the low-level world of DX12 and see if I can wrap my head around it, maybe even create something useful along the way.

There aren’t many beginner-friendly resources for learning DX12, so this is me working through the challenges. Hopefully, this journey will help others who are struggling with the same tech. In the future, I might write a guide to help people get started, but for now, I’m focused on building and learning at a steady pace.

## What's Done So Far

Here’s a quick checklist of what I’ve implemented so far:

- [x] **Created helper and error classes**
- [x] **Created device creation class**
- [x] **Created fence and swapchain classes**
- [x] **Created window class**

## Resources for Learning DX12

I know how tough it can be to get started with DX12, especially with the limited resources available. Microsoft’s samples and the Mini Engine are helpful, but they aren’t the best starting points if you’re new to DX12. However, here are some resources that can help you get started (trust me, that initial momentum is key):

- [3D GEP (By Jeremiah)](https://www.3dgep.com/category/graphics-programming/directx/)
- [DirectX Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples)

My advice is to go through Jeremiah’s tutorials first. They’ll give you a solid foundation before you dive into the samples. The samples also include the "MiniEngine," which demonstrates a lot of DX12 features, but I’d recommend coming back to it once you’ve worked through the tutorials and feel comfortable with the basics.

## That’s about it for now
